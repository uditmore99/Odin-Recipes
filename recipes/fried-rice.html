    <p>
      Chinese fried rice is the quintessential comfort food. Think of it—a bowl
      of steaming white rice cooked to just the right consistency, filled with
      bits of meat and vegetable. No wonder fried rice is one of the world's
      most popular rice dishes! For the home cook, the beauty of fried rice is
      that it is very adaptable. Like chow mein, it's perfect for those nights
      when you're cleaning out the refrigerator and want to get rid of any
      leftover meat or vegetables.
